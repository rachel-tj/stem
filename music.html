       welcome to my music and photo gallery! if you hover over the polaroid, you can see when i first heard that song.  i tried to incorporate different music tastes.  it's definetly a work in progress, but i think that it's pretty adequate as of right now.  maybe i'll do something where if you click the polaroid it will start playing the song.  that would mean i need some audio stuff. if you have any music recommentations, email them to <a id="mailLink" href="mailto:rst68@case.edu">rachel</a>. otherwise, enjoy the gallery!
